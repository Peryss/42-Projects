# 42 Projects

## About
- 42 journey: peer-to-peer learning, strict norms, and lots of debugging.
- Focus: C fundamentals, algorithms, low-level systems, and graphics.
- Goal: build reliable, readable code and collaborate effectively.

## Core Projects
- Libft — custom C standard library (memory, strings, lists) used across later work.
- get_next_line — buffered, line-by-line reader handling tricky edge cases.
- ft_printf — formatted output clone with flags, widths, and precision.
- pipex — Unix pipeline recreation with forks, pipes, and heredoc handling.
- push_swap — constrained stack-based sorting with move optimization.
- philosophers — concurrency with pthreads, mutexes, and timing constraints.
- fract-ol — interactive fractal viewer (Mandelbrot/Julia) with MiniLibX.
- CPP Modules — C++ exercises (00–09) covering OOP basics, inheritance, polymorphism, templates.
- Piscine — early C foundations and problem-solving drills.

## Collaborative Projects (partner-owned repos)
- minishell — tiny Bash-like shell: parsing, env handling, redirections, pipes. Repo: https://github.com/Peryss/Minishell
- ft_irc — RFC-compliant IRC server basics: sockets, polling, client management. Repo:https://github.com/krabitsch/05_ft_irc_42
- cube_3D — raycaster game (Wolf3D-style) with textures and input. Repo:

## Skills & Tools
- Languages: C (ISO C99), Bash
- Topics: memory management, pointers, data structures, concurrency, graphics, parsing
- Tooling: gcc, make, valgrind, gdb, MiniLibX, POSIX threads

## Next Up
- Better testing harnesses for C projects
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Systems-level projects with networking and IPC

## Connect
- Open to pair-debugging, code reviews, and sharing tips on passing Moulinette.
- Feel free to open issues or start discussions on any of these projects.
